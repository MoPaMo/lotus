I am building this app for my mother, who works as a paediatrician with children with chronic pain diseases. 

The app works as a guide / reminder of methods for relaxation / distraction from that pain, e. g. breathing excercises, being mindful and many more

👷 App is currently German only, i11n coming soon :D
